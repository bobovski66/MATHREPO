  <!-- Problem 1: CI for a proportion -->
  <div class="problem">
    <div class="label">Problem 1 (CI for a proportion)</div>
    <p>
      At a community college, a random sample of \(n = 150\) students is asked whether they
      work at a paid job during the semester. In the sample, \(93\) students say “yes.”
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Compute the sample proportion \(\hat{p}\) of students who work.</li>
      <li>
        Construct a \(95\%\) confidence interval for the true proportion \(p\) of all students
        at this college who work during the semester.
      </li>
      <li>
        Interpret your interval in a single sentence in the context of the problem.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <details>
      <summary>Show solution</summary>
      <h4>Step 1: Sample proportion</h4>
      <p>
        \[
        \hat{p} = \frac{\text{number of “yes”}}{n}
               = \frac{93}{150}
               = 0.62.
        \]
        So, \(62\%\) of the sample works during the semester.
      </p>

      <h4>Step 2: Check conditions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Random sample: stated in the problem.</li>
        <li>Large enough sample: we want \(n\hat{p} \ge 10\) and \(n(1-\hat{p}) \ge 10\).
          \[
          n\hat{p} = 150(0.62) = 93 \ge 10,\quad
          n(1-\hat{p}) = 150(0.38) = 57 \ge 10.
          \]
          Conditions are satisfied.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Step 3: Compute the CI</h4>
      <p>
        Use the formula for a \(95\%\) CI for a population proportion:
        \[
        \hat{p} \pm z^\ast \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}},
        \]
        where \(z^\ast \approx 1.96\) for \(95\%\) confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        First find the standard error:
        \[
        \text{SE}
        =
        \sqrt{\frac{0.62(1-0.62)}{150}}
        =
        \sqrt{\frac{0.62 \cdot 0.38}{150}}
        \approx \sqrt{\frac{0.2356}{150}}
        \approx \sqrt{0.00157}
        \approx 0.0396.
        \]
      </p>
      <p>
        Margin of error:
        \[
        \text{ME} = z^\ast \cdot \text{SE}
        = 1.96 \cdot 0.0396
        \approx 0.0776.
        \]
      </p>
      <p>
        CI:
        \[
        0.62 \pm 0.0776
        = (0.5424,\; 0.6976).
        \]
        Rounded:
        \[
        (0.54,\; 0.70).
        \]
      </p>

      <h4>Step 4: Interpretation</h4>
      <p>
        We are \(95\%\) confident that the true proportion of all students at this community
        college who work at a paid job during the semester is between \(54\%\) and \(70\%\).

  <!-- Problem 2: CI for a mean -->
  <div class="problem">
    <div class="label">Problem 2 (CI for a mean)</div>
    <p>
      A statistics instructor wants to estimate the average amount of time per week
      her students spend on this course (including class, homework, and studying).
      She takes a random sample of \(n = 25\) students and finds:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sample mean: \(\bar{x} = 6.4\) hours</li>
      <li>Sample standard deviation: \(s = 2.1\) hours</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Assume the conditions for using a \(t\)-interval are met.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Construct a \(95\%\) confidence interval for the true mean number of hours
        students spend on the course per week.
      </li>
      <li>State the interval in a complete sentence.</li>
    </ol>

    <details>
      <summary>Show solution</summary>
      <h4>Step 1: Identify what we are estimating</h4>
      <p>
        We want a CI for the population mean \(\mu\): the true average weekly time
        students spend on the course.
      </p>

      <h4>Step 2: Use the one-sample \(t\) CI formula</h4>
      <p>
        The \(95\%\) CI for \(\mu\) is
        \[
        \bar{x} \pm t^\ast \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}},
        \]
        where \(t^\ast\) comes from a \(t\)-distribution with \(n-1 = 24\) degrees of freedom.
      </p>

      <p>
        For \(95\%\) confidence and \(24\) df, \(t^\ast \approx 2.064\) (from a table or technology).
      </p>

      <h4>Step 3: Compute the standard error and margin of error</h4>
      <p>
        \[
        \text{SE} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{2.1}{\sqrt{25}} = \frac{2.1}{5} = 0.42.
        \]
      </p>
      <p>
        \[
        \text{ME} = t^\ast \cdot \text{SE}
        = 2.064 \cdot 0.42
        \approx 0.867.
        \]
      </p>

      <h4>Step 4: Construct the interval</h4>
      <p>
        \[
        \bar{x} \pm \text{ME}
        = 6.4 \pm 0.867
        = (6.4 - 0.867,\; 6.4 + 0.867)
        = (5.533,\; 7.267).
        \]
        Rounded, about \((5.53,\; 7.27)\) hours.
      </p>

      <h4>Step 5: Interpretation</h4>
      <p>
        We are \(95\%\) confident that the true average time students at this college
        spend on the course per week is between about \(5.5\) and \(7.3\) hours.

    <p>
      A survey of \(n = 80\) adults in a city finds that their average daily screen time
      (phone, computer, TV) is \(\bar{x} = 5.1\) hours, with a sample standard deviation of
      \(s = 1.8\) hours. A local health group claims the mean screen time in the city is
      \(\mu = 4.5\) hours.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Construct a \(95\%\) confidence interval for the true mean screen time \(\mu\).
        Assume conditions for a \(t\)-interval are met.
      </li>
      <li>
        Based on your interval, does the data support or contradict the health group’s
        claim of \(\mu = 4.5\) hours? Explain briefly.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <details>
      <summary>Show solution</summary>
      <h4>Step 1: CI for the mean</h4>
      <p>
        Use
        \[
        \bar{x} \pm t^\ast \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}},
        \]
        with \(\bar{x} = 5.1\), \(s = 1.8\), \(n = 80\).
      </p>
      <p>
        Degrees of freedom: \(n-1 = 79\). For a \(95\%\) CI, \(t^\ast \approx 1.99\)
        (very close to the normal value \(1.96\)).
      </p>

      <p>
        Standard error:
        \[
        \text{SE} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
        = \frac{1.8}{\sqrt{80}}
        \approx \frac{1.8}{8.944}
        \approx 0.201.
        \]
      </p>

      <p>
        Margin of error:
        \[
        \text{ME} = t^\ast \cdot \text{SE}
        \approx 1.99 \cdot 0.201
        \approx 0.40.
        \]
      </p>

      <p>
        CI:
        \[
        5.1 \pm 0.40
        = (4.70,\; 5.50).
        \]
      </p>

      <h4>Step 2: Compare with the claim \(\mu = 4.5\)</h4>
      <p>
        The claimed value \(\mu = 4.5\) hours is <strong>not</strong> inside the
        \(95\%\) confidence interval \((4.70,\; 5.50)\).
      </p>
      <p>
        This suggests that \(4.5\) hours is not a plausible value for the true mean
        based on this sample. The data <strong>contradict</strong> the health group’s claim
        at the \(95\%\) confidence level.

      <li>Find (or approximate) the p-value.</li>
      <li>State your conclusion in context.</li>
    </ol>

    <details>
      <summary>Show solution</summary>
      <h4>Step 1: Hypotheses</h4>
      <p>
        Let \(p\) be the true proportion of all students who commute more than 20 miles.
      </p>
      <p>
        \[
        H_0: p = 0.40
        \]
        \[
        H_a: p \neq 0.40
        \]
        (two-sided test, because we are checking whether it “has changed.”)
      </p>

      <h4>Step 2: Sample proportion and conditions</h4>
      <p>
        \[
        \hat{p} = \frac{60}{120} = 0.50.
        \]
      </p>
      <p>
        Check counts under \(H_0\):
        \[
        n p_0 = 120(0.40) = 48 \ge 10, \quad
        n(1-p_0) = 120(0.60) = 72 \ge 10.
        \]
        Normal approximation is appropriate.
      </p>

      <h4>Step 3: Test statistic</h4>
      <p>
        Use
        \[
        z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{\dfrac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}}.
        \]
      </p>
      <p>
        \[
        z
        =
        \frac{0.50 - 0.40}{\sqrt{\dfrac{0.40(0.60)}{120}}}
        =
        \frac{0.10}{\sqrt{\dfrac{0.24}{120}}}
        =
        \frac{0.10}{\sqrt{0.002}}
        =
        \frac{0.10}{0.04472}
        \approx 2.24.
        \]
      </p>

      <h4>Step 4: P-value</h4>
      <p>
        This is a two-sided test, so
        \[
        p\text{-value} = 2P(Z \ge |2.24|).
        \]
        Looking up \(z = 2.24\) (or using technology) gives
        \(P(Z \ge 2.24) \approx 0.0125\).
      </p>
      <p>
        So
        \[
        p\text{-value} \approx 2(0.0125) = 0.025.
        \]
      </p>

      <h4>Step 5: Decision and conclusion</h4>
      <p>
        Compare the p-value to \(\alpha = 0.05\):
        \[
        0.025 < 0.05 \Rightarrow \text{reject } H_0.
        \]
      </p>
      <p>
        There is statistically significant evidence at the \(5\%\) level that the
        true proportion of students who commute more than 20 miles is no longer \(0.40\).
        In this sample, the estimate is higher (\(0.50\)).

      <h4>Step 1: Hypotheses</h4>
      <p>
        Let \(\mu\) be the true mean number of steps per day for members.
      </p>
      <p>
        The claim “at least \(10{,}000\)” means the null is \(\mu = 10{,}000\)
        and we test for less:
        \[
        H_0: \mu = 10{,}000
        \]
        \[
        H_a: \mu < 10{,}000.
        \]
      </p>

      <h4>Step 2: Test statistic</h4>
      <p>
        Use the one-sample \(t\)-test:
        \[
        t
        =
        \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}}
        =
        \frac{9{,}200 - 10{,}000}{1{,}600 / \sqrt{16}}.
        \]
      </p>
      <p>
        \[
        s / \sqrt{n} = \frac{1{,}600}{4} = 400.
        \]
        So
        \[
        t = \frac{-800}{400} = -2.0.
        \]
      </p>

      <p>
        Degrees of freedom: \(n - 1 = 15\).
      </p>

      <h4>Step 3: P-value</h4>
      <p>
        We need \(P(T_{15} \le -2.0)\). Using a \(t\)-table or technology,
        \(P(T_{15} \le -2.0)\) is around \(0.03\) (exact value depends on table).
      </p>
      <p>
        So the p-value is approximately \(0.03\).
      </p>

      <h4>Step 4: Decision and conclusion</h4>
      <p>
        Compare to \(\alpha = 0.05\):
        \[
        0.03 < 0.05 \Rightarrow \text{reject } H_0.
        \]
      </p>
      <p>
        There is statistically significant evidence at the \(5\%\) level that the
        true mean number of steps per day for members is <strong>less</strong> than \(10{,}000\).

        n(1-p_0) = 90(0.40) = 36 \ge 10.
        \]
        Normal approximation is fine.
      </p>

      <p>
        Test statistic:
        \[
        z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{\dfrac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}}
          = \frac{0.689 - 0.60}{\sqrt{\dfrac{0.60 \cdot 0.40}{90}}}.
        \]
      </p>
      <p>
        Denominator:
        \[
        \sqrt{\dfrac{0.24}{90}} = \sqrt{0.002666\ldots} \approx 0.0516.
        \]
      </p>
      <p>
        So
        \[
        z \approx \frac{0.089}{0.0516} \approx 1.72.
        \]
      </p>

      <h4>Step 3: P-value</h4>
      <p>
        Since \(H_a: p > 0.60\), this is a right-tailed test:
        \[
        p\text{-value} = P(Z \ge 1.72).
        \]
        From a normal table or technology,
        \(P(Z \ge 1.72) \approx 0.043\).
      </p>

      <h4>Step 4: Decision and conclusion</h4>
      <p>
        Compare to \(\alpha = 0.05\):
        \[
        0.043 < 0.05 \Rightarrow \text{reject } H_0.
        \]
      </p>
      <p>
        There is statistically significant evidence at the \(5\%\) level that
        more than \(60\%\) of students who attend at least four tutoring sessions
        pass their math class.
      </p>

      <h4>Step 5: CI connection (one-sided)</h4>
      <p>
        A one-sided \(95\%\) lower confidence bound for \(p\) would look like
        \[
        p > \hat{p} - z^\ast \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}
        \]
        with an appropriate \(z^\ast\) for a one-sided \(95\%\) bound.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since our test at \(\alpha = 0.05\) rejected \(H_0: p = 0.60\) in favor
        of \(p > 0.60\), the one-sided lower bound should be
        <strong>above</strong> \(0.60\). In other words, the CI perspective and the
        hypothesis test are consistent: both suggest that \(p\) is greater than \(0.60\).
