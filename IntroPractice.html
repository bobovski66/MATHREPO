            A study is done to determine the average tuition that San Jose State undergraduate students pay per semester. Each student in the following samples is asked how much tuition they paid for the Fall semester. What is the type of sampling in each case?<br>
            <ul>
                <li>a. A sample of 100 undergraduate San Jose State students is taken by organizing the studentsâ€™ names by classification (first-year, sophomore, junior, or senior), and then selecting 25 students from each.</li>
                <li>b. A random number generator is used to select a student from the alphabetical listing of all undergraduate students in the Fall semester. Starting with that student, every 50th student is chosen until 75 students are included in the sample.</li>
                <li>c. A completely random method is used to select 75 students. Each undergraduate student in the fall semester has the same probability of being chosen at any stage of the sampling process.</li>
                <li>d. The first-year, sophomore, junior, and senior years are numbered one, two, three, and four, respectively. A random number generator is used to pick two of those years. All students in those two years are in the sample.</li>
                <li>e. An administrative assistant is asked to stand in front of the library one Wednesday and to ask the first 100 undergraduate students he encounters what they paid for tuition the Fall semester. Those 100 students are the sample.</li>

            Suppose ABC College has 10,000 part-time students (the population). We are interested in the average amount of money a part-time student spends on books in the fall term. Asking all 10,000 students is an almost impossible task.<br><br>
            Suppose we take two different samples.<br><br>
            First, we use convenience sampling and survey ten students from a first-term organic chemistry class. Many of these students are also taking first-term calculus in addition to the organic chemistry class. The amount of money they spend on books is as follows:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>\$128; \$67; \$175; \$116; \$120; \$44; \$87; \$150; \$93; \$153</li>
            </ul>
            The second sample is taken using a list of senior citizens who take P.E. classes and taking every fifth senior citizen on the list, for a total of ten senior citizens. They spend:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>\$50; \$40; \$36; \$15; \$50; \$100; \$40; \$32; \$23; \$22</li>
            </ul>
            It is unlikely that any student is in both samples.<br><br>

            <strong>Problem:</strong> a. Do you think that either of these samples is representative of (or is characteristic of) the entire 10,000 part-time student population?

            <p>No. The first sample probably consists of science-oriented students. Besides the chemistry course, some of them are also taking first-term calculus. Books for these classes tend to be expensive. Most of these students are, more than likely, paying more than the average part-time student for their books.</p>
            <p>The second sample is a group of senior citizens who are, more than likely, taking courses for health and interest. The amount of money they spend on books is probably much less than the average part-time student. Both samples are biased. Also, in both cases, not all students have a chance to be in either sample.</p>

        <div class="question-content">
            <strong>Problem:</strong> b. Since these samples are not representative of the entire population, is it wise to use the results to describe the entire population?

            <p>No. For these samples, each member of the population did not have an equally likely chance of being chosen.</p>

        <div class="question-content">
            Suppose we take a third sample. We choose ten different part-time students from the disciplines of chemistry, math, English, psychology, sociology, history, nursing, physical education, art, and early childhood development. We assume that these are the only disciplines in which part-time students at ABC College are enrolled (and that an equal number of part-time students are enrolled in each of the disciplines). Each student is chosen using simple random sampling. Using a calculator, random numbers are generated and a student from a particular discipline is selected if they have a corresponding number. The students spend the following amounts:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>\$180; \$80; \$150; \$85; \$26; \$75; \$180; \$200; \$200; \$150</li>

            <p>The sample is unbiased, but a larger sample would be recommended to increase the likelihood that the sample will be close to representative of the population. However, for a biased sampling technique, even a large sample runs the risk of not being representative of the population.</p>
            <p>Students often ask if it is "good enough" to take a sample, instead of surveying the entire population. If the survey is done well, the answer is yes.</p>
