            Determine what the key terms refer to in the following study.<br><br>
            As part of a study designed to test the safety of electric automobiles, the National Transportation Safety Board collected and reviewed data about the effects of a crash on test dummies. Here is the criterion they used:<br>
            <table style="width: 100%; border: 1px solid #333; border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center;">
                <tr>

                </tr>

                </tr>
            </table><br>
            Cars with dummies in the front seats were crashed into a wall at a speed of 35 miles per hour. We want to know the proportion of dummies in the driverâ€™s seat that would have had head injuries, if they had been actual drivers. We start with a simple random sample of 75 cars.

            You go to the supermarket and purchase three cans of soup (19 ounces tomato bisque, 14.1 ounces lentil, and 19 ounces Italian wedding), two packages of nuts (walnuts and peanuts), four different kinds of vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, and carrots), and two desserts (16 ounces pistachio ice cream and 32 ounces chocolate chip cookies).<br><br>

            <ul>
                <li>The three cans of soup, two packages of nuts, four kinds of vegetables, and two desserts are quantitative discrete data because you count them.</li>
                <li>The weights of the soups (19 ounces, 14.1 ounces, 19 ounces) are quantitative continuous data because you measure weights as precisely as possible.</li>
                <li>Types of soups, nuts, vegetables, and desserts are qualitative data because they are categorical.</li>
